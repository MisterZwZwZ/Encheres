# Enchères
Here is an auction/trading website made with Java EE at ENI School.

## What is it ?
As a user, this web app alows you to :
- browse goods that are currently available for sale without having an account 
- create an account, log in and out
- edit your profile
- put objects for sale on the web site
- modify and cancel a sale if the auctions haven't started yet for this item
- do advanced research thanks to filters and search bar
- display details about the items that are for sale and the current state of auctions
- place an auction on an item that is currently on sale if you have enough credit 
- win an auction if you have the highest bet at the end of the sell
- browse previous items that you have bought or sold
- delete your profile if you currently don't have any items on sale

## Why ? 
This is the result of a group project made with two other learners at ENI School. The main goal was to build a back-end web application with java. 
The project lasted two weeks and alowed us to use many concept such as DAO design pattern, MVC Architecture, DOM interaction...
